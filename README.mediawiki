= Spaces Improvement Proposals (SIPs) =

The SIP process is adapted from [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips BIPs]. People wishing to submit SIPs should first propose their idea or document to the relevant community forums (do '''not''' assign a number). Read [[sip-001.mediawiki|SIP 1]] for the full process. After discussion and feedback, open a pull request. Once the proposal has been reviewed and copy-edited, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving SIPs, and we try not to make decisions on behalf of the community. The exception is in rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a SIP in this repository does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately, consent may rest with the consensus of the Spaces users.
